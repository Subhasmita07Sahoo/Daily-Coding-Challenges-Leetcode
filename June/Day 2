135. Candy

You are given two positive integers n and limit.
Return the total number of ways to distribute n candies among 3 children such that no child gets more than limit candies.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, limit = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 ways to distribute 5 candies such that no child gets more than 2 candies: (1, 2, 2), (2, 1, 2) and (2, 2, 1).


//T.C : O(n)
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int candy = n; //Each person given one candy

        int i = 1;
        while (i < n) {

            if (ratings[i] == ratings[i - 1]) {
                i++;
                continue;
            }

            //For increasing slope
            int peak = 0;
            while (i < n && ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                peak++;
                candy += peak;
                i++;
            }

            //For decreasing slope
            int valley = 0;
            while (i < n && ratings[i] < ratings[i - 1]) {
                valley++;
                candy += valley;
                i++;
            }
            candy -= Math.min(peak, valley);
        }

        return candy;

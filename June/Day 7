3170. Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars

You are given a string s. It may contain any number of '*' characters. Your task is to remove all '*' characters.
While there is a '*', do the following operation:
Delete the leftmost '*' and the smallest non-'*' character to its left. If there are several smallest characters, you can delete any of them.
Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all '*' characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aaba*"
Output: "aab"
Explanation:
We should delete one of the 'a' characters with '*'. If we choose s[3], s becomes the lexicographically smallest.


class P {
    public char c;
    public int i;
    public P(char c, int i) {
        this.c = c;
        this.i = i;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public String clearStars(String s) {
        char[] str = s.toCharArray();
        Queue<P> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> {
           if (a.c == b.c) {
               return b.i - a.i;
           }
            return Character.compare(a.c, b.c);
        });
        
        for (int i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
            char c = str[i];
            if (c != '*') {
                pq.add(new P(c, i));
                continue;
            }
            
            if (!pq.isEmpty()) {
                P p = pq.poll();
                str[p.i] = '*';
            }
        }
        char[] result = new char[str.length]; 
        int index = 0;
        for (char c : str) {
            if (c != '*') {
                result[index++] = c;
            }
        }
        return new String(result, 0, index); 
    }
}

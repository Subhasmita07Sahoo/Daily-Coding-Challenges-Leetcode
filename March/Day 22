2685. Count the Number of Complete Components

You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n vertices, numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting vertices ai and bi.
Return the number of complete connected components of the graph.
A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.
A connected component is said to be complete if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.


Example 1:

Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the picture above, one can see that all of the components of this graph are complete.


class Solution {
    private void dfs(int i, Map<Integer, List<Integer>> adj, boolean[] visited, int[] info) {
        visited[i] = true;
        info[0]++;
        info[1] += adj.getOrDefault(i, new ArrayList<>()).size();
        
        for (int ngbr : adj.getOrDefault(i, new ArrayList<>())) {
            if (!visited[ngbr]) {
                dfs(ngbr, adj, visited, info);
            }
        }
    }
    
    public int countCompleteComponents(int n, int[][] edges) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> adj = new HashMap<>();
        int result = 0;
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            adj.computeIfAbsent(edge[0], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(edge[1]);
            adj.computeIfAbsent(edge[1], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (visited[i]) continue;
            
            int[] info = new int[2];
            dfs(i, adj, visited, info);
            
            if (info[0] * (info[0] - 1) == info[1]) {
                result++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;

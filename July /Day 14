1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.


Example 1:

Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10


class Solution {

    public int getDecimalValue(ListNode head) {
        int result = 0;
        while(head != null) {
            result = (result << 1) | head.val;
            head = head.next;
        }
        return result;
    }
}

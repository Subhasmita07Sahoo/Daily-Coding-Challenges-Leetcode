2163. Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.

You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:

The first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sumfirst.
The next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sumsecond.
The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.

For example, if sumfirst = 3 and sumsecond = 2, their difference is 1.
Similarly, if sumfirst = 2 and sumsecond = 3, their difference is -1.
Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,2]
Output: -1


class Solution {
    public long minimumDifference(int[] nums) {
        int N = nums.length; // 3*n
        int n = N / 3;
        
        long[] leftMinSum = new long[N];
        long[] rightMaxSum = new long[N];
        
        // Max heap for left side (to keep n smallest elements)
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        long leftSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
            maxHeap.offer(nums[i]);
            leftSum += nums[i];
            
            if (maxHeap.size() > n) {
                leftSum -= maxHeap.poll();
            }
            
            leftMinSum[i] = leftSum;
        }
        
        // Min heap for right side (to keep n largest elements)
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        long rightSum = 0;
        for (int i = N - 1; i >= n; i--) {
            minHeap.offer(nums[i]);
            rightSum += nums[i];
            
            if (minHeap.size() > n) {
                rightSum -= minHeap.poll();
            }
            
            rightMaxSum[i] = rightSum;
        }
        
        long result = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i <= 2 * n - 1; i++) {
            result = Math.min(result, leftMinSum[i] - rightMaxSum[i + 1]);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}

3160. Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls

You are given an integer limit and a 2D array queries of size n x 2.
There are limit + 1 balls with distinct labels in the range [0, limit]. Initially, all balls are uncolored. For every query in queries that is of the form [x, y], you mark ball x with the color y. After each query, you need to find the number of distinct colors among the balls.
Return an array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of distinct colors after ith query.
Note that when answering a query, lack of a color will not be considered as a color.

Example 1:

Input: limit = 4, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[1,3],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,2,3]

Explanation:

After query 0, ball 1 has color 4.
After query 1, ball 1 has color 4, and ball 2 has color 5.
After query 2, ball 1 has color 3, and ball 2 has color 5.
After query 3, ball 1 has color 3, ball 2 has color 5, and ball 3 has color 4

class Solution {
    public int[] queryResults(int limit, int[][] queries) {
        int n = queries.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> colormp = new HashMap<>(); // color -> count
        Map<Integer, Integer> ballmp = new HashMap<>(); // ball -> color
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int ball = queries[i][0];
            int color = queries[i][1];
            
            if (ballmp.containsKey(ball)) { // already colored ball
                int prevColor = ballmp.get(ball);
                colormp.put(prevColor, colormp.get(prevColor) - 1);
                
                if (colormp.get(prevColor) == 0) {
                    colormp.remove(prevColor);
                }
            }
            
            ballmp.put(ball, color);
            colormp.put(color, colormp.getOrDefault(color, 0) + 1);
            
            result[i] = colormp.size();
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
